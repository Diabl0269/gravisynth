 *  2. Conflict detection is SCOPED to a category (see ShortcutManager::getConflictingAction). The

 *     in the timeline is not in competition with a bare P anywhere else — reporting that as a

 *  General is the residual, and deliberately wide: anything routed by
 *  MainComponent::resolveEditSurface() (copy/paste/cut/duplicate/repeat/select-all, and both zoom

     *
     *   - the two are equal — key code compared case-insensitively, modifiers compared EXACTLY,
     *     which is what keeps Left / Shift+Left / Alt+Left three separate bindings and what keeps
     *     Ctrl+Shift+1 from ever matching a bare 1; OR
     *   - BOTH sides carry Shift and their key codes share a US-layout unshifted base — '!' and '1'
     *     are one physical key, so Ctrl+Shift+'!' fires the binding stored as Ctrl+Shift+'1'.
     *
     *  An invalid binding (an action the user cleared, or an id this build has never heard of)
     *  matches nothing.
     *
     *  WHY THE SECOND BRANCH EXISTS — the bug it fixes. On macOS,
     *  juce_NSViewComponentPeer_mac.mm's getKeyCodeFromEvent() derives a KeyPress's key code from
     *  `[ev charactersIgnoringModifiers]`, and its own comment concedes: "Unfortunately,
     *  charactersIgnoringModifiers does not ignore the shift key" — it compensates ONLY by
     *  upper-casing letters. So a Shift-chorded digit or symbol reaches keyPressed carrying the
     *  SHIFTED character as its key code: Ctrl+Shift+1 arrives as KeyPress('!', ctrl|shift) and
     *  never equalled the stored '1'. That killed the entire Ctrl+Shift+digit grid block AND both
     *  Cmd+Shift zoom keys (Cmd+Shift+'=' arrives as '+') in the real app, while every headless test
     *  stayed green — a test builds KeyPress('1', mods) directly and never goes through the peer.
     *
     *  LIMITATION, stated plainly: the table below is the US ANSI layout. Doing this properly needs
     *  the platform VIRTUAL key code, which identifies the physical key independently of layout and
     *  which juce::KeyPress does not carry — the peer has already collapsed the event to a character
     *  before any of our code sees it. On a layout where Shift+3 is not '#' (UK, French, German…)
     *  the affected chord falls back to exact match, i.e. exactly the behaviour it had before this
     *  function existed: nothing gets worse, and the layouts covered are the overwhelming majority.
