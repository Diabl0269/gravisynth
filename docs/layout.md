# Layout System Reference

This document describes the soft-grid layout model: how modules snap to an 8 px grid, how the
anti-overlap spiral search resolves collisions on drop and drag-release, how `autoArrange`
computes a topological signal-flow layout, and the full `LayoutUtil` API reference.

## 1. Soft-Grid Model

Agent Synth uses a **soft grid** — the same approach taken by Max/MSP, Bitwig Grid, and Blender's
node editor. Modules are free-form (you can place them anywhere on the 10000×10000 canvas), but
two layout rules are always enforced:

1. **Snap on drag-release.** When you finish dragging a module, its top-left corner rounds to the
   nearest 8 px multiple.
2. **Anti-overlap on drop/drag.** When a module lands on top of another one, the engine performs
   a spiral search to find the nearest clear slot, then places the module there instead.

These rules fire only at the moment of release, not on every drag tick. Live-tick snapping would
stair-step the position and fight `ModuleComponent`'s buffered-image compositing; the soft-grid
style avoids that entirely.

### Coordinate space

All layout and collision logic operates in **canvas coordinates** — the `content` child component,
bounded `0, 0, 10000, 10000`. The zoom/pan transform lives on `content.setTransform(...)` and is
invisible to `LayoutUtil`. Never pass screen-space coordinates into layout functions.

Module positions are persisted on the JUCE audio-graph node's property bag as integer keys `"x"`
and `"y"`. `GraphEditor::updateComponents()` reconciles those values back to
`setTopLeftPosition(x, y)` after every state change (preset load, undo/redo, auto-arrange).

---

## 2. kGridSize = 8 — Rationale

The grid quantum is 8 px for several complementary reasons:

- **Port jack vertical spacing is 20 px; module header height is 30 px.** 8 px is the smallest
  quantum that feels snappy and invisible — coarser grids (16, 20) can misalign jack-to-jack
  connections visually at high zoom.
- **All auto-arrange spacing constants are multiples of 8.** `kLayerGapX = 80`,
  `kIntraLayerGapY = 40`. Auto-arranged modules therefore land on-grid with no rounding residual.
- **The spiral step equals kGridSize.** Every candidate position the spiral search tries is
  already on-grid, so a module placed by anti-overlap is guaranteed to be grid-aligned.
- **Standard module width 280 = 35 × 8.** Flush tiling: a row of standard modules has no
  inter-module remainder when laid out at the grid quantum.

---

## 3. Anti-Overlap Spiral Search

When a module is placed (library drop or drag-release), the engine:

1. Snaps the desired top-left position to the nearest grid multiple.
2. Checks whether the snapped rectangle (at the module's actual pixel dimensions) overlaps any
   other module, using a minimum clear gap of `kCollisionGap = 12 px` between bounding boxes.
3. If the slot is clear, places the module there — done.
4. Otherwise, walks an **expanding square spiral** outward from the desired position, testing each
   grid-aligned candidate, until it finds a clear slot or exhausts
   `kSpiralMaxRings = 256` rings (256 × 8 = 2048 px search radius). If no clear slot is found
   within the radius the snapped-desired position is returned as a fallback — always a valid
   on-canvas coordinate.

The spiral visits positions in ring order (innermost first) so the module lands as close to the
intended drop point as possible.

### Collision inflaton rule

Two boxes A and B collide (with gap `g`) when:

```
A.inflated(g/2).intersects(B.inflated(g/2))
```

which is equivalent to requiring at least `g` px of clear space on all sides between the edges.
The `selfId` parameter lets a module exclude its own box from the occupied set — used during
drag so a module does not collide with its own pre-drag position.

---

## 4. Auto-Arrange (Cmd+L / "Auto Arrange" button)

`GraphEditor::autoArrange()` rearranges all visible modules into a left-to-right
**topological signal-flow layout** in one undo step.

### 4.1 Algorithm

**Step 1 — Collect arrangeable nodes.**
All graph nodes whose processor is a `ModuleBase` subclass (which includes *Audio
Input*), plus the `AudioGraphIOProcessor` IO nodes — *Audio Output* and, in any patch still
holding one, a raw `audioInputNode`. `AttenuverterModule` nodes are skipped entirely — they are
implementation details of the modulation graph and do not appear as visible module cards.

**Step 2 — Build directed edges.**
Edges are gathered from `AudioProcessorGraph::getConnections()`, skipping any edge that touches
an `AttenuverterModule` node. Additionally, modulation routing edges from
`AudioEngine::getModulationRoutings()` (source → destination, collapsing attenuverter chains to
logical endpoints) are added as `extraEdges`. Duplicate edges and self-loops are removed.

**Step 3 — Assign signal-flow depth via longest-path.**
A Kahn-style topological traversal assigns each node a depth equal to the length of the longest
incoming path. Nodes with no incoming edges get depth 0. Any cycle is broken by ignoring
back-edges to already-visited nodes so the traversal always terminates. The Audio Output IO node
is forced to the maximum depth (rightmost column).

**Step 4 — Group nodes into layers.**
All nodes at the same depth form one layer (column). Within a layer, nodes are sorted by
**role rank** for a stable, readable ordering:

| Rank | Module types |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Oscillator, Sequencer, MIDI Keyboard |
| 1 | Filter, VCA |
| 2 | FX modules (Delay, Reverb, Distortion, …) |
| 3 | ADSR, LFO |

Nodes at equal rank are then sorted by node UID for full determinism across runs.

**Step 5 — Assign pixel coordinates.**

```
x = kArrangeOriginX          // 40 px left margin
for d in 0..maxDepth:
    layerWidth = max(sizeOf(n).x for n in layers[d])
    y = kArrangeOriginY      // 40 px top margin per column
    for n in layers[d]:
        nodeX = x + (layerWidth - w) / 2   // centre narrow cards in wide column
        emit { n, snap({nodeX, y}) }
        y += h + kIntraLayerGapY            // 40 px between cards
    x += layerWidth + kLayerGapX            // 80 px between columns
```

Every emitted position is passed through `snap()` and clamped to
`[0, kCanvasMax − w] × [0, kCanvasMax − h]`.

### 4.2 Spacing constants

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `kLayerGapX` | 80 px | Horizontal gap between adjacent layer columns |
| `kIntraLayerGapY` | 40 px | Vertical gap between stacked modules in the same layer |
| `kArrangeOriginX` | 40 px | Left margin — where the first layer column starts |
| `kArrangeOriginY` | 40 px | Top margin — where every layer column's first module starts |

All four constants are multiples of `kGridSize`, so auto-arranged positions are always on-grid.

### 4.3 Undo integration

`autoArrange()` wraps all position writes in a single undo snapshot:
`undoManager->captureBeforeState(graph)` before computing the layout,
`undoManager->pushSnapshotFromCapture(graph)` after calling `updateComponents()`. Pressing
Cmd+Z once restores every module to its pre-arrange position.

## 5. Toolbar & Status Bar Layout

The application chrome is carved out of `MainComponent::resized()` — the single canonical layout method. It slices top→bottom:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐  ← toolbar strip  (height: Metrics::toolbarHeight = 44 px)
│  [Lib] [Save][Load][Cfg][⟲][⟳][⬜]   ···   [Matrix][AI]  │
├──────────┬──────────────────────┤
│  Library │                      │  ← library sidebar  (width: Metrics::librarySidebarWidth = 200 px, or 0 when hidden)
│ (200 px) │    Graph canvas      │
│          │                      │  ← AI panel clips right (width: Metrics::aiPanelWidth = 300 px, or 0 when hidden)
├──────────┴──────────────────────┤
│  [Patch Name]  CPU  RT  Voices  [🔇] │  ← status bar  (height: Metrics::statusBarHeight = 24 px)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The three dockable panels (library, AI, timeline) are carved at **their open fraction times their
full size**, not at a binary read of their visible/hidden flag: "or 0 when hidden" above is the
fraction resting at 0, and any value in between is a frame of the panel's slide. That is what makes
this method safe to call at any moment — a window resize, a theme change or a timeline height drag
*during* a slide re-derives the same proportions — and it is the whole animation mechanism: a
toggle moves the fraction and calls back in here. See `docs/layout_visuals_animation.md` §3's `PanelSlide` subsection.

### ToolbarComponent `paint()`

`paint()` fills the toolbar background with `theme.colors.bg0` via a `dynamic_cast<AppLookAndFeel*>`. When the cast returns null (headless tests or non-themed context), it falls back to the hardcoded colour `0xff0B0D10`.

### Toolbar FlexBox layout (`ToolbarComponent`)

`ToolbarComponent::layoutButtons(bounds)` runs a single `juce::FlexBox` (row, align-center):
- Left group: Library, Save, Load, Settings, Feedback, Undo, Redo, AutoArrange
- Flex spacer (`withFlex(1.0f)`) — fills available gap
- Right group: ToggleModMatrix, ToggleAiPanel

**Narrow mode** fires when `bounds.getWidth() <= Metrics::minWindowWidth` (480 px). In narrow mode, all button `prefWidth` = 32 (icon-only). In wide mode each button has a labelled preferred width (Library 96, Save 112, Load 116, Settings 96, Undo 72, Redo 72, AutoArrange 120, ToggleModMatrix 104, ToggleAiPanel 92). `Feedback` (P6-17) sits in the same sub-group as `Settings` (`groupOf()` returns the same id for both, so no separator is drawn between them) and is always icon-only — its preferred width is a fixed 40 regardless of narrow/wide mode, since it never grows a text label.

### Narrow-mode gate in `MainComponent::resized()`

`applyToolbarIcons()` clones `Drawable` objects from the icon cache to set button images. To avoid a clone storm on every resize, the call is **gated to narrow-mode transitions only**:

```cpp
bool prevNarrow = toolbarNarrowMode_;
toolbar.layoutButtons(toolbarBounds);       // updates toolbar.isNarrowMode()
toolbarNarrowMode_ = toolbar.isNarrowMode();
if (toolbarNarrowMode_ != prevNarrow)
    applyToolbarIcons();                    // re-clone only on mode flip
```

`applyToolbarIcons()` is also called unconditionally once at the end of `initialiseCommon()` and after every theme switch (via `changeListenerCallback`).

**Sub-group visual grouping**: `ToolbarComponent`'s local `groupOf(slot)` helper maps each `Slot`
to the sub-group it documents, and `layoutButtons()` inserts a 12px spacer `FlexItem` at every
sub-group boundary within the left/right loops; `paint()` draws a 1px border-token hairline at the
midpoint of each intra-section sub-group gap (using the buttons' own post-layout bounds, guarded on
non-null && `isVisible()`), excluding the left/right section boundary (the existing `withFlex(1.0)`
spacer). No-ops when the `LookAndFeel` isn't the themed `AppLookAndFeel` (headless test runner).

**Toggle pills**: `applyToolbarIcons()` and `MainComponent::setLibraryVisible()` both call
`setToggleState(..., juce::dontSendNotification)` on their panel-toggle button (Library, Minimap,
ModMatrix, AiPanel, Timeline under its `#if` guard) so the button's toggle state always matches
panel visibility — always `dontSendNotification`, never `setClickingTogglesState`, so a button's
own `onClick` never double-fires. The pill's
hover/press/toggled-on paint states are fully owned by `AppLookAndFeel::drawDrawableButton`
rather than delegated to `LookAndFeel_V4::drawDrawableButton` — the stock `LookAndFeel_V2` base
does an unconditional flat `g.fillAll()` keyed only on toggle state, with no hover/press
distinction and no rounding. The toggled-on state is a ~13/15/20% (rest/hover/press) accent wash
with a 0.35-alpha 1px stroke — an "active" tint, not a filled button — and icon+label colour steps
through a `textMuted → textPrimary (hover/press) → accent (on)` / `textDisabled` ladder: the label
in `drawDrawableButton` (fixed 11px, bottom-docked with a 6px pad, replacing the stock formula
that starved it at `min(16, 25%·height)`), the icon via tinted `Drawable` clones built in
`MainComponent::applyToolbarIcons()` (`retintIcons()` tints the base `textMuted`; hover/on
variants are `replaceColour`'d and wired through `setImages`' state slots). A uniform
`DrawableButton::setEdgeIndent(8)` on all toolbar buttons is what keeps icon optical size
(~17-19px) consistent regardless of button width — height, not width, is the binding constraint
in `getImageBounds()`.

### Metrics layout tokens (code-only)

The following `Metrics` struct fields govern chrome layout. They are **not parsed from user JSON** — a user theme may not override them. `ThemeLoader` silently ignores them (unknown-key forward-compatibility). Their values come from the C++ struct defaults only.

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `toolbarHeight` | 44 | Toolbar strip height (px) — sized so an ~18px icon and an 11px label fit with real breathing room (36px starved the label to ~7-9px via `DrawableButton`'s built-in geometry) |
| `statusBarHeight` | 24 | Status bar strip height (px) |
| `controlPadding` | 4 | Inset around toolbar buttons (px) |
| `minWindowWidth` | 480 | Narrow-mode breakpoint (= minimum window width) |
| `minWindowHeight` | 400 | Minimum window height reference |
| `sidebarCollapsedWidth` | 0 | Library width when hidden (px) |
| `librarySidebarWidth` | 200 | Library width when visible (px) |
| `aiPanelWidth` | 300 | AI panel width when visible (px) |
| `iconSize` | 16 | Icon render size in library/status bar contexts (px) |

### Minimum window size

`Main.cpp` `MainWindow` ctor calls `setResizeLimits(480, 400, 8192, 8192)` — a hard platform floor on the `DocumentWindow` before `centreWithSize(1600, 900)`. This prevents the window from shrinking below the minimum where toolbar buttons could clip to zero width. `Metrics::minWindowWidth`/`minWindowHeight` carry the same values as layout constants for use in `ToolbarComponent`'s narrow threshold and tests.

### StatusBarComponent

The status bar (`Source/UI/StatusBarComponent.h/.cpp`) is a 24 px high strip rendered at the bottom of `MainComponent`.

**Layout:**
- Patch name: left-aligned (padded 6 px from left edge)
- CPU %: centre section, drawn in `theme.colors.warning` when above 80 %, otherwise `textMuted`
- **Round trip**: `RT <n> ms`, immediately after the CPU figure (`x = 236`, 90 px wide), `textMuted`. Drawn only while it *fits* before the voice-count slot — a cramped window drops the segment rather than overlapping two readings — and only once a first reading has arrived
- **Transport cluster**: a play/stop glyph button (16×16) immediately after the round-trip segment (`x = 236 + 90 + 6 = 332`), followed by a `"bar.beat.ticks   BPM"` readout (118 px wide). Drawn/shown only while the whole cluster fits before the voice-count slot — the same fit-check-then-drop the round-trip segment uses, computed in `resized()` rather than `paint()` because the button is a live child component that must actually be hidden (`setVisible(false)`), not merely left undrawn. The glyph is accent-coloured while playing (the "obviously running" cue) and a neutral outline while stopped, same triangle/square shapes as `TimelineTransportBar::GlyphButton`'s own PlayStop case, reproduced rather than shared since `StatusBarComponent` lives in Core and cannot depend on AppUI. **Always visible regardless of the timeline panel's visibility** — before this, play/stop/position only existed inside `TimelineTransportBar`, a child of the (often-hidden) timeline panel
- Voice count: right-aligned before the mute button slot
- `masterMuteButton_` (`DrawableButton`): positioned in `resized()` at `(w-28, 2, 20, h-4)`

**Update contract:**
`update(float cpuPct, int voices, const juce::String& patch)` is gated — it only calls `repaint()` when any value changes by a visible amount (cpu delta > 0.5 %, voice count changed, or patch name changed). It contains **zero `writeToLog` calls**.

`updateRoundTripLatency(double milliseconds, bool available)` is a **sibling** setter with its own gate, so a moving CPU figure never repaints on account of an unchanged latency or vice versa. Its diff is on the **rendered string**, which means a latency drifting below the printed resolution costs no repaint at all. It shows `AudioEngine::getRecordingLatencySamples()` (input device + graph + output device — the amount a recorded take is shifted back by; see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md)'s "Latency alignment" section), fed from the same 5 Hz poll. `available == false` — Hosted mode, where the host owns both ends — draws `RT —` rather than a made-up number.

`updateTransport(bool playing, const juce::String& positionText, double bpm)` is another **sibling** setter, gated independently on `(playing, positionText, bpm)`: it builds `positionText + "   " + bpm (1 dp) + " BPM"` and only repaints (and calls `transportButton_.setToggleState(playing, dontSendNotification)`) when that diff changes. `positionText` arrives **pre-formatted** by the caller — normally `synth::ui::TimelineTransportBar::formatBarBeat(ppq, tsNumerator, tsDenominator)` — because `StatusBarComponent` is compiled into the `Core` CMake target, which cannot depend on `AppUI` (where `TimelineTransportBar` lives); `MainComponent` (in `AppUI`) is the one call site that does the formatting. Fed from `MainComponent::timerCallback`'s existing 5 Hz status-bar sub-tick, using the `PositionSnapshot` already read **unconditionally** every 10 Hz tick (before the `timelinePanel.isVisible()` guard) — see `docs/architecture.md`'s timerCallback inventory. The play/stop button's own click is wired by `MainComponent` to the same `TransportService::play()`/`stop()` calls `TimelineTransportBar`'s button uses; the button never flips its own toggle state (`setClickingTogglesState(false)` — "the transport is the truth", `updateTransport()` is the only setter).

**Tooltips:**
The patch name, CPU %, round-trip, and transport-readout segments are **painted text, not child components**, so there is nothing for `juce::TooltipWindow` (the one instance MainComponent owns — `docs/theming.md`'s "TooltipWindow" entry) to hit-test individually. `StatusBarComponent` is instead itself a `juce::TooltipClient`: `getTooltip()` delegates to `getTooltipForPosition(juce::Point<int>)`, a pure/const helper that maps a LOCAL point to tooltip text using the exact same x-ranges `paint()` draws into (`isRoundTripSegmentVisible()` is shared by both, so the two can never disagree about whether a segment is currently on screen). `juce::TooltipWindow::getTipFor()` checks only the exact component the mouse is over and does not walk up parents, so hovering `masterMuteButton_`/`transportButton_` (both real child components, both already `SettableTooltipClient` via `juce::Button`) reaches THEIR OWN tooltip text — `getTooltip()` is never invoked for them.

Tooltip text (verified against what each value actually reads):
- **CPU %**: "Audio-engine DSP load: percentage of the audio callback's time budget spent rendering this block." — the value itself is `audioEngine.isHosted() ? 0.0f : deviceManager.getCpuUsage() * 100.0` (JUCE's own callback-time-budget figure; hosted mode has no device of its own, so it shows 0 rather than a misleading reading).
- **Round trip**: "Round-trip latency: input device + audio graph + output device delay - the amount a recorded take is shifted back to line it up." — the value is `AudioEngine::getRecordingLatencySamples()` converted to ms (see `updateRoundTripLatency`'s doc comment above and `architecture.md`'s "Latency alignment" section). Only answered while `isRoundTripSegmentVisible()` is true — a hidden segment has no tooltip.
- **Transport readout**: "Playback position (bar.beat.ticks) and tempo (BPM)."
- **Transport play/stop button**: "Play / Stop" (`setTooltip()` in the ctor — same text `TimelineTransportBar`'s own play/stop button uses).

A transient message (`showMessage()`) suppresses every tooltip on the row (`getTooltipForPosition` returns `""` immediately) since it visually covers the segments it would otherwise explain.

**Polling rate:**
The status bar polls at 5 Hz, driven by `MainComponent`'s 10 Hz timer via an every-other-tick guard (`statusBarTickCount_`).

**Static format helpers** (headless-testable, no JUCE GUI deps):
- `formatCpu(float fraction)` — fraction is 0..1; `0.756f → "75.6%"`
- `formatVoices(int n)` — `0 → "0 voices"`, `1 → "1 voice"`, `8 → "8 voices"`
- `formatPatch(const juce::String& s)` — empty or whitespace-only → `"Untitled"`
- `formatRoundTrip(double ms, bool available)` — `(12.34, true) → "RT 12.3 ms"`; `(anything, false) → "RT —"`; negative input clamps to `0.0`

### ModuleLibraryComponent section headers

Each category section-header entry in `ModuleLibraryComponent::paint()` draws a 16×16 category icon at `x=10` using `lf->peekIcon(catIcon)`, then shifts the header text to `x=30`. This is null-guarded: when the `AppLookAndFeel` cast returns null (headless tests or assets absent), no icon is drawn and header text falls back to the original `x=10` position.

### ModuleLibraryComponent search

A `juce::TextEditor` is pinned at the top of the library (`kSearchHeight = 32`), above the COLLAPSE ALL strip. Together they form `kPinnedChromeHeight` — the scrollbar, row clip, and hit-testing all start below that band so a scrolled row cannot steal a click from the search field.

Typing a query (trimmed, case-insensitive substring) filters `buildRows()`:

- A module or snippet row is kept when its name contains the query, or when its section header contains the query (so searching `"Time"` shows Delay and Reverb).
- A section with no remaining children is omitted entirely.
- Matching sections are drawn fully open regardless of `collapsedSections`. The stored fold is not rewritten and `onCollapseStateChanged` does not fire, so clearing the field restores the user's collapse state.
- The matching substring is painted with the theme accent (fill + coloured glyphs) via `highlightSpansFor`. A query that matches nothing leaves the list empty and draws "No matching modules".
- Filtering is layout-only: `getDraggableModuleNames()` still returns every factory type.

### ModuleLibraryComponent search

A `juce::TextEditor` is pinned at the top of the library (`kSearchHeight = 32`), above the COLLAPSE ALL strip. The two together are `kPinnedChromeHeight`; rows and the scrollbar live below that band, so the field never scrolls away.

Typing a query (trimmed, case-insensitive substring):

- Hides module, snippet, and empty-hint rows that do not contain the query.
- A section stays visible when its header matches **or** any of its children match. A header match reveals every child in that section (searching "Time" shows Delay and Reverb).
- Matching sections layout as fully open. The stored collapse set is not rewritten and `onCollapseStateChanged` does not fire, so clearing the field restores the fold the user had.
- Matching runs in the visible label are highlighted (accent fill + accent text). `highlightSpansFor` is the pure helper paint uses; tests cover it directly.
- No hits: `buildRows()` is empty and the body draws "No matching modules".

Escape clears the field. `getDraggableModuleNames()` is unfiltered — callers that instantiate via the factory must not see a search-shrunk catalogue.

The search field's `TextEditor` colours are re-applied in `parentHierarchyChanged()`, in addition
to `lookAndFeelChanged()`. `MainComponent`'s ctor applies the persisted theme in its ctor *body*,
after `moduleLibrary` (a plain member) was already default-constructed against whatever theme was
active before that — so without this, the field showed stale colours until the next theme switch.
`parentHierarchyChanged()` fires when `MainComponent::initialiseCommon()` calls
`addAndMakeVisible(moduleLibrary)`, which always runs after that ctor-body `applyTheme()` call.

### ModMatrixComponent chrome

`Source/UI/ModMatrixComponent.h/.cpp` paints rows with the following visual rules:

- **Row height**: `static constexpr int kRowHeight = 48` (was 40)
- **Zebra striping**: odd rows (`isZebraRow(rowIndex)` — `rowIndex % 2 == 1`) are tinted with `theme.colors.surfaceHi.withAlpha(0.45f)`; even rows are transparent (parent background shows through)
- **Hover highlight**: the currently hovered row is tinted with `theme.colors.accent.withAlpha(0.10f)`, overriding the zebra base
- **Hover tracking**: `ModRow::mouseEnter` calls `owner.setHoveredRow(rowIndex)`; `ModRow::mouseExit` calls `owner.setHoveredRow(-1)` only when that row still owns the hover, avoiding races when the cursor moves between rows. The `hoveredRow_` member defaults to `-1` (no hover)
- **Static helper**: `static bool isZebraRow(int rowIndex) noexcept` — exposed for unit tests
- **Column alignment**: header labels and `ModRow`'s combo columns share `kRowNumColW`(30) /
  `kSourceColFrac`(0.30f) / `kDestColFrac`(0.35f) / `kGutter`(8) constants on `ModMatrixComponent`,
  so they can't drift apart
- **Row separator**: a 1px `theme.colors.border` hairline is painted at the bottom of every row (in
  addition to zebra/hover), and above the footer band
- **Grouped-menu labels bake in the module name**: the closed `ComboBox`'s label resolves ONLY from
  the matching leaf item's own text (JUCE never concatenates ancestor submenu titles), so a
  multi-output/multi-target module's nested source/dest submenu leaves are text like
  `"<Module> · Out N"` / `"<Module> · <target>"`, not a bare `"Out 2"`. `updateRowsFromGraph()`
  re-populates every row's combos (`populateCombos()`) BEFORE re-applying its selection
  (`refresh()`), because `populateCombos()` clears the combo box as a side effect of rebuilding it.
- **Bypass/delete controls are `DrawableButton`** (`Icon::ModuleBypass`/`Icon::ModuleDelete`,
  `ImageFitted`), not `TextButton` — retinted via `ModRow::applyButtonIcons()`, called from the
  constructor and from `ModRow::lookAndFeelChanged()`, mirroring
  `ModuleComponent::applyHeaderButtonIcons()`. The bypass-active state uses
  `juce::DrawableButton::backgroundOnColourId` (a `TextButton`-only id would be ignored by
  `DrawableButton`'s look-and-feel path).
- **Amount readout**: a small `amountValueLabel` next to the amount slider shows the current value
  to 2 decimals, updated via the slider's `onValueChange` plus one explicit push right after
  `SliderParameterAttachment` construction (its constructor does not itself fire `onValueChange`).
- The empty-state message ("No modulations active…") now draws inside the post-header/footer
  `area` rect, not `getLocalBounds()`, so it no longer overlaps the title/header bands.

### Custom card titles (double-click the header to rename)

Double-clicking a module card's **header band** (`ModuleComponent::kHeaderHeight`, 24px) opens an
inline `juce::TextEditor` over the title. Return or clicking away commits, Escape cancels, and the
editor is seeded with whatever the header currently shows so a first rename starts from `Chorus 2`
rather than an empty box. It is a **child component**, so there is no window seam to stub out for a
display-less test run. Themed for free: `AppLookAndFeel` already overrides
`fillTextEditorBackground` / `drawTextEditorOutline`.

**The custom title is NOT the processor's name.** `ModuleBase::getName()` is the auto-numbered
`"Chorus 2"`, and `AudioEngine::updateModuleNames()` recomputes every one of those **wholesale on
every graph change** — it strips a trailing number off each name and renumbers per base type. A
custom title written there would be clobbered by the next node the user adds, and worse, `"My Chorus
2"` would have its `2` stripped and be renumbered into `"My Chorus 3"`. So the custom title lives in
the node property **`displayName`**, and the numbered processor name stays the fallback:
`GraphEditor::getModuleTitle()` returns the custom one when set, else `processor->getName()`. Card
paint goes through `ModuleComponent::cardTitle()` and never reads the processor name directly.

Consequences worth knowing:

- Renaming one instance does not disturb any other instance's number, and a later instance still
  auto-numbers correctly (a renamed `Chorus 1` does not free up the name — the count is per base
  type over all nodes). Pinned by `AutoNumberingStillAppliesAlongsideCustomTitles`.
- Blank or whitespace-only reverts to the numbered default rather than showing an empty header.
- Typing the numbered name back in stores **blank**, so the card keeps following the numbering
  instead of freezing today's number as a literal custom title.
- `displayName` is message-thread-only and display-only, so it is deliberately **not** mirrored into
  the processor the way `uuid` is: nothing on the audio thread reads a card title, so there is no
  lock-free read to make sound and a mirror would only add a second copy to keep in sync.

**Gesture ordering.** The double-click is intercepted in `mouseDown` on `getNumberOfClicks() >= 2`,
*before* `dragStartPosition` / `bodyDragActive` are touched — the same interception the port
double-click uses. The first click of the pair has already armed and disarmed a body drag; letting
the second arm another would leave `bodyDragActive` set under an open editor, so the next stray
`mouseDrag` would walk the card out from under the cursor. Pinned by
`ModuleTitleRenameDoesNotArmABodyDrag`.

**Undo** goes through `recordStructuralChange`, which is also what makes the title survive an
undo/redo of any *other* structural change: the snapshot is `graphToJSON`, so the title has to be
serialized (below) for undo to restore it at all.

### ModuleComponent header button layout

The header area of each module card (`Source/UI/ModuleComponent.cpp`) contains `DrawableButton` instances (not `TextButton`), positioned in `resized()`:

| Button | Bounds | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `deleteButton` | `(w-26, 2, 22, 20)` | Calls `owner.requestDeleteModule(nodeId)` — tooltip "Delete module" |
| `bypassButton` | `(w-50, 2, 22, 20)` | Toggles bypass state — tooltip "Bypass" |
| `muteButton` | `(w-74, 2, 22, 20)` | Toggles mute state — tooltip "Mute" |
| `dualIOButton` | `(w-98, 2, 22, 20)` | Stereo-capable modules only — every type in `AIStateMapper::dualIOCapableModuleTypes()` (the FX, Voice Mixer and Ring Modulator outputs, and the split-block voice modules). Splits or merges the stereo jack pair; tooltip names Dual I/O. |

`requestDeleteModule(NodeID)` is the canonical delete entry point — `deleteButton.onClick` delegates here.

`applyHeaderButtonIcons()` retints the header buttons from the active `AppLookAndFeel`. It is null-guarded: when the LnF cast fails (headless tests), the function returns early and buttons remain imageless but functional. `lookAndFeelChanged()` calls `applyHeaderButtonIcons()` so icons update on theme switch.

The header title text itself is drawn by `AppLookAndFeel::drawModulePanel()` with an asymmetric
inset — `header.withTrimmedLeft(22.0f)` — so the activity LED (`fillEllipse(6, 8, 8, 8)`, x = [6,14])
never overlaps the title, regardless of whether the LED is currently lit.

### Audio Output card identity treatment

Audio Output is a bare `juce::AudioGraphIOProcessor`, not a `ModuleBase`, so it otherwise renders
through the exact same generic path as every other card (its `getType()` falls back to
`ModuleType::Oscillator` — see the free function at the top of `ModuleComponent.cpp`). Two small,
purely additive blocks in `ModuleComponent::paint()` give it its own identity, both gated on a
local `isAudioOutputIONode(juce::AudioProcessor*)` helper (`dynamic_cast` to
`AudioGraphIOProcessor` + an `IODeviceType == audioOutputNode` check — the same type-not-name idiom
`isTerminalAudioSink` in `GraphEditor.cpp` uses for cable routing, so a `ModuleBase` named "Audio
Output" cannot impersonate the sink):

- **Identity glyph** — the `synth::theme::Icon::CatIO` speaker glyph, in the activity LED's slot
  (Audio Output is never a `ModuleBase`, so it never has a `VisualBuffer` and `cachedRMS` never
  leaves `0.0f` for this card — that slot is otherwise always dark) but sized and positioned by
  `ModuleComponent::outputCardIconBoundsForTest()` (public purely so a test can assert the exact
  geometry `paint()` draws) rather than a fixed box:
  - **Size** — a square equal to the title's cap-height, computed as `titleFont.getAscent() *
    0.72f` for the title's own font (`theme.type.h2`, bold — JUCE has no direct cap-height query,
    and 0.72× ascent is the standard sans-serif approximation, close to Inter's real ratio). This
    keeps the glyph proportional to the title (roughly cap-height, e.g. ~9–10px at the default
    13pt title size) instead of the header's full 24px band, which read "a touch large/heavy"
    next to the letter-spaced caps.
  - **Vertical position** — centred on the title's cap-height optical centre, derived from the
    SAME centred-text-box math `drawText` uses to place the title (`textBoxTop =
    headerTop + (headerHeight - titleFont.getHeight()) / 2`, `baseline = textBoxTop +
    titleFont.getAscent()`, `capCentreY = baseline - capHeight / 2`) rather than the header
    band's raw geometric middle — the previous fixed placement centred on the full ascent+descent
    box the title is drawn in, which reads slightly low against cap-height-only glyphs (an
    all-caps title never touches the descender clearance that box reserves).
  - **Horizontal position** — right edge pinned to `x = 14`, the activity LED's own right edge
    (`fillEllipse(6, 8, 8, 8)`), so the gap to the title's left inset (`x = 22`) stays the
    established 8px rhythm regardless of the glyph's resulting width.
  - **Colour** — re-tinted per paint from the library's baked-in `textMuted` to whichever colour
    token the title itself is using this frame (`accent` when selected, `textDisabled` when
    bypassed, `textPrimary` otherwise — mirrors `drawModulePanel`'s title-colour logic exactly) via
    `Drawable::replaceColour` on an owned clone from `AppLookAndFeel::getIcon()`, never the shared
    `peekIcon()` view other cards/the library sidebar also read — so the glyph and the title always
    read as one lockup instead of a fixed muted tint next to a colour-shifting title.
- **Destination line** — one muted (`theme.type.micro`, `colors.textMuted`) text line under the
  header, e.g. `"MacBook Pro Speakers · 48 kHz · 2ch"`. Sourced **message-thread-only** from
  `AudioEngine`'s device state and pushed in through a small chain rather than read directly:
  `MainComponent::computeOutputDeviceInfoText()` (branches on `AudioEngine::isHosted()` — Hosted
  mode has no device manager, so it returns the fixed string `"Host audio"` instead of touching
  one; a Standalone build with no device open yet returns an empty string) is installed as a
  `std::function<juce::String()>` via `GraphEditor::setOutputDeviceInfoProvider`, and
  `GraphEditor::refreshOutputDeviceInfo()` calls it and pushes the result into the Audio Output
  `ModuleComponent` via `setOutputDeviceInfoText()`. An empty string means "draw no line", not an
  empty one. There is no timer: `refreshOutputDeviceInfo()` is called once right after the provider
  is installed (so the card is populated at startup) and again from
  `AudioEngine::onDeviceStateChanged`, right alongside the existing
  `refreshIoModulesAfterDeviceChange()` call that already re-points Audio Input's jacks on a device
  change. `setOutputDeviceInfoText()` repaints (the normal `ZoomFrozenCachedImage` invalidation
  seam — see `docs/layout_visuals_animation.md` §2/§3) only when the text actually changed, and is a no-op on every module that
  isn't the terminal audio sink, so a caller never needs to check `isAudioOutputIONode()` first.

The library sidebar's "I/O" category header (Audio Input / Audio Output) uses the same `CatIO`
icon via `ModuleLibraryComponent::categoryIconForHeader` — see docs/theming.md's icon list.

### Panel collapse and persistence

Library sidebar and AI panel can each be fully hidden (width = 0). State persists across launches via `ApplicationProperties`:

| Key | Default | Component |
|---|---|---|
| `librarySidebarVisible` | `"1"` (true) | `moduleLibrary` left panel |
| `aiPanelVisible` | `"0"` (false) | `aiChatComponent` right panel |

Both keys are read at the top of `initialiseCommon()` before any `setVisible()` or `addAndMakeVisible()` call. Cmd+B toggles the library sidebar (wired via `ShortcutManager`).

### Welcome screen overlay (T114/P8-10)

`Source/UI/WelcomeScreenComponent` is a full-window overlay, not a docked panel — it covers the toolbar and canvas alike while shown, rather than carving a strip out of either. Two rules keep it correctly positioned and stacked:

- **Added LAST.** `MainComponent::initialiseCommon()` calls `addAndMakeVisible(*welcomeScreen_)` after every other `addAndMakeVisible()` call in the constructor — JUCE paints/z-orders children in add order, so this is what makes it sit on top of the toolbar buttons and canvas rather than underneath them.
- **Resized on every layout pass, visible or not.** `MainComponent::resized()`'s last line is `if (welcomeScreen_) welcomeScreen_->setBounds(getLocalBounds());` — the FULL window bounds, not whatever's left after the toolbar/status-bar/panels have carved their own strips out of the local `bounds` variable. Running this unconditionally (not gated on `isVisible()`) means a stale rect from before the last window resize can never show through the instant `showWelcomeScreen()` makes it visible again.

App-only, gated on `ownedAudioEngine != nullptr` — see `docs/architecture.md`'s "Welcome screen" subsection for the full gating rationale, the persisted `"showWelcomeScreenAtLaunch"` key, and the guard-before-hide ordering that keeps a Cancel answer from dismissing it.

## 6. Module Width Buckets

Phase 3 standardizes module card widths into three named buckets defined in `LayoutUtil.h`:

| Bucket | Constant | Width | Modules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Narrow` | `kNarrowWidth` | 40 px | AttenuverterModule |
| `Single` | `kSingleWidth` | 280 px | Oscillator, Filter, VCA, ADSR, LFO, FX modules, VoiceMixer, PolyMidi, all others |
| `Double` | `kDoubleWidth` | 560 px | Sequencer, PolySequencer, MidiKeyboard |

`kDoubleWidth == 2 × kSingleWidth` — a Double module occupies exactly two standard column slots. Attenuverter modules are excluded from the visible module card grid (they do not appear as `ModuleComponent` cards and are skipped by auto-arrange).

### Module body layout (`ModuleComponent::layoutDefaultContent`)

Every module that does not have a bespoke layout (Sequencer, PolySequencer, MidiKeyboard, ADSR,
Attenuverter) is laid out by one function, `layoutDefaultContent(bool apply)`. It runs twice per
size change — once with `apply = false` to measure the height, once with `apply = true` from
`resized()` to position the children — so the measured height and the real positions cannot drift
apart. They previously *did* drift: two hand-maintained copies of the geometry disagreed, and body
content was drawn on top of the lowest port labels.

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kKnobColumns` | 3 | knobs per row |
| `kContentMargin` | 12 | left/right gutter for body content |
| `kNarrowContentWidth` | 200 | combos / toggles / the Sampler load row, centred |
| `kLabelHeight` | 18 | label above a knob or combo |
| `kRowHeight` | 24 | combo box, toggle, button |
| `kKnobHeight` | 58 | rotary + its text box |
| `kWaveformHeight` | 72 | Sampler waveform overview |
| `kPortLabelClearance` | 15 | gap below the lowest jack before body content starts |

Generic bool-parameter toggles, and the `freqResponse`/`spectrum`/`scope` show/hide toggles, lay
out at full `contentX`/`contentW` (flush-left with the knob grid), not the centred
`narrowX`/`narrowW` band — a toggle's label reads better flush-left than centred in a narrow
column.

**Body content always starts below every jack.** `getContentTopY()` derives that y from
`getPortCenter()` — the same function that anchors wires — rather than recomputing the port
geometry, so content can never land on a port label again. Because the body is below the ports, it
does not need the narrow gutters that used to keep it clear of the port labels, which is what makes
three knobs per row fit inside the 280 px card.

The header-to-first-port gap also grew from 1 px to 9 px (base header offset constant `30 → 38` in
both `getContentTopY()` and `getPortCenter()`), giving the MIDI In/Out row breathing room under the
header hairline — every height below already includes that +8 px.

Three columns instead of two removes a knob row from most modules; the header-offset shift above
adds a further +8 px on top. Measured heights (`GraphEditor::estimateModuleSize()` mirrors these
for the library drag ghost; `ModuleComponentTest.EstimatedModuleSizesMatchTheRealComponents`
constructs every library-offered type and fails if this table drifts from what
`layoutDefaultContent()` actually produces):

| Module | Height (px) | Module | Height (px) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Oscillator | 553 | Sample & Hold | 571 |
| Filter | 463 | Comparator | 205 |
| LFO | 361 | Sampler | 665 |
| VCA | 273 | Chorus / Phaser / Flanger | 297 |
| ADSR | 359 | Bitcrusher | 343 |
| Poly MIDI | 205 | Pitch Shifter | 487 |
| Distortion | 343 | Compressor | 257 |
| Ring Modulator | 411 | Limiter | 181 |
| Delay | 257 | Voice Mixer | 321 |
| Reverb | 257 | External MIDI | 146 |
| Noise | 301 | Rec Tap / Track Audio / Hosted Plugin | 131 |
| Envelope Follower | 315 | Math | 259 |

Unchanged: Sequencer / PolySequencer 406, MidiKeyboard 150, Macros (tracks its `Knobs` count),
Attenuverter (square, `kNarrowWidth`), Wavetable 554, Parametric EQ 592, AudioInput / AudioOutput
(100 px floor).

### Modules that resize at runtime

Widths are static, but one module's **height** is not: the Macro bank (`MacroControlModule`) grows
and shrinks with its `Knobs` parameter. Its geometry lives in `LayoutUtil.h` so the component
layout, the output-jack hit test and `estimateModuleSize` all read the same numbers:

```cpp
kMacroHeaderH  = 94   // title bar + Knobs / Bipolar row
kMacroRowH     = 44   // one macro knob and its output jack
kMacroBottomPad = 12

macroBankHeight(count) == kMacroHeaderH + count * kMacroRowH + kMacroBottomPad
macroRowCentreY(index) == kMacroHeaderH + index * kMacroRowH + kMacroRowH / 2
```

Growth is **anchored at the top-left and pushes neighbours, never itself**. Moving the module the
user is currently interacting with would teleport it out from under the cursor, so
`GraphEditor::handleModuleResized` instead feeds every module box to
`LayoutUtil::resolveOverlapsAfterResize` and applies the displacements it returns. Shrinking
returns an empty result set — nothing is pulled back up, the canvas just gains space.

### Column stride derivation

```
kColumnStride = kSingleWidth + kLayerGapX = 280 + 80 = 360 px
```

`kColumnStride` is not a named constant; it is the natural result of the auto-arrange algorithm. DOUBLE-width modules advance the column cursor by `kDoubleWidth + kLayerGapX = 640 px`.

### Auto-arrange with DOUBLE modules

`computeAutoArrange` uses the `sizeOf` callback to query each module's pixel width. For a Sequencer node the callback returns `{kDoubleWidth, 380}`, so `layerWidth` for that column becomes 560 and the next column starts at `x += 560 + 80 = 640`. Downstream modules are pushed rightward correctly without overlap.

### Preset column/row model (authoritative: `Source/PresetManager.cpp` lines 38–81)

Factory preset positions follow a fixed column/row grid. The **column x-positions** are not uniformly strided — they reflect actual module widths plus a ≥12 px collision gap:

| Column | x | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Col 0 | 10 | IO nodes, Sequencer, MIDI Keyboard |
| Col 1 | 350 | Oscillator |
| Col 2 | 650 | Filter |
| Col 3 | 950 | VCA |
| Col 4 | 1250 | FX chain (Distortion / Delay / Reverb) |
| Col 5 | 1560 | Audio Output |

The stride between columns is ~300 px and variable — **not** the uniform 360 px value. (`kColumnStride = 360` is the auto-arrange algorithm's column advance for single-width modules, a separate concept.)

**Row y-positions:**

| Row | y | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Signal row | 10 | Osc, Filter, VCA, FX chain |
| Sequencer row | 560 | Sequencer (bottom edge = 940) |
| Modulator row | 600 | AmpEnv, FilterEnv, LFO |
| Keyboard row | 960 | MIDI Keyboard |

### Preset position rebake (presets 0, 1, 5)

Factory presets 0, 1, and 5 contain a Sequencer at x=10 (right edge = 570). After switching the Sequencer to `kDoubleWidth = 560`, the AmpEnv and FilterEnv positions were rebaked to avoid overlap:

- **AmpEnv**: x=560 → x=**584** (570 + 12 gap + 2 grid ceil)
- **FilterEnv**: x=870 → x=**880** (584 + 280 + 12 gap + 4 grid ceil)

Presets 2, 3, 4, 6 have no Sequencer-adjacent envelopes and required no rebake. The `AllFactoryPresetsLoadWithoutOverlap` test and the `estimateModuleSize` mirror in `Tests/PresetManagerTests.cpp` are updated atomically with the preset data change to keep the test green.

### Poly Pad preset routing (case 6)

The Poly Pad factory preset routes **Amp Env → VCA per-voice CV** (PolyBus, VCA ports 8–15) only. There is **no** Amp Env → Osc Level (ch12) DirectCV connection in this preset.

## 7. LayoutUtil API Reference

`Source/UI/LayoutUtil.h` / `Source/UI/LayoutUtil.cpp` — no JUCE GUI component dependencies;
testable headlessly.

### Constants

```cpp
namespace synth::LayoutUtil {

inline constexpr int kGridSize       = 8;    // snap quantum
inline constexpr int kCollisionGap   = 12;   // minimum clear gap between bounding boxes (px)
inline constexpr int kSpiralStep     = 8;    // spiral ring step — equals kGridSize
inline constexpr int kSpiralMaxRings = 256;  // hard cap: 256*8 = 2048 px search radius
inline constexpr int kCanvasMax      = 10000;
inline constexpr int kLayerGapX      = 80;
inline constexpr int kIntraLayerGapY = 40;
inline constexpr int kArrangeOriginX = 40;
inline constexpr int kArrangeOriginY = 40;

// Module width buckets (see section 6)
inline constexpr int kNarrowWidth  = 40;   // Attenuverter
inline constexpr int kSingleWidth  = 280;  // standard module
inline constexpr int kDoubleWidth  = 560;  // Sequencer / PolySequencer / MidiKeyboard

enum class ModuleWidthBucket { Narrow, Single, Double };
ModuleWidthBucket getModuleWidthBucket(ModuleType t);  // defined in LayoutUtil.cpp; requires ModuleBase.h in caller
int moduleWidth(ModuleWidthBucket b);
int moduleWidth(ModuleType t);

} // namespace synth::LayoutUtil
```

### `snap`

```cpp
int snap(int v);
juce::Point<int> snap(juce::Point<int> p);
```

Rounds `v` to the nearest multiple of `kGridSize`. Negative-safe (uses `std::lround`).
The two-argument overload snaps both components of a point independently.

### `Box`

```cpp
struct Box {
    NodeID              id;
    juce::Rectangle<int> rect;
};
```

Represents one occupied slot: the JUCE graph `NodeID` plus the module's pixel bounding rectangle
in canvas coordinates. Build this list from the live module components for collision testing.

### `intersectsAny`

```cpp
bool intersectsAny(const juce::Rectangle<int>& candidate,
                   const std::vector<Box>& others,
                   NodeID selfId,
                   int gap = kCollisionGap);
```

Returns `true` if `candidate` (inflated by `gap`) overlaps any box in `others` whose `id` is not
`selfId`. Pass the dragged module's own `NodeID` as `selfId` to exclude it from its own
collision set during a drag.

### `findFreeSlot`

```cpp
juce::Point<int> findFreeSlot(juce::Point<int> desired, int w, int h,
                              const std::vector<Box>& others,
                              NodeID selfId,
                              int gap = kCollisionGap);
```

Finds the nearest grid-aligned top-left position where a `w × h` box does not overlap any entry
in `others` (excluding `selfId`). Starts at `snap(desired)`, then walks an expanding square
spiral at step `kSpiralStep` for up to `kSpiralMaxRings` rings. Returns `snap(desired)` (clamped
to canvas) if no clear slot is found within the search radius — never returns an out-of-bounds
position.

### `resolveOverlapsAfterResize`

```cpp
inline constexpr int kResolveMaxRounds = 4;

std::vector<ArrangeResult>
resolveOverlapsAfterResize(NodeID resizedId,
                           const std::vector<Box>& boxes,
                           int gap = kCollisionGap);
```

Called after a module changes footprint in place. `boxes` is every module box **including** the
resized one, already carrying its new rect. Returns a new top-left for each *other* box that had
to move; boxes that stayed put are not returned, so an empty result means the new footprint fitted
as-is.

The resized module is never returned and never moves. Displaced boxes are pushed straight down
past the lowest thing they collided with, then run through `findFreeSlot`, so results are on-grid
and gap-respecting. The sweep is deterministic (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right, then id) and
the cascade is capped at `kResolveMaxRounds` passes.

---

### `computeAutoArrange`

```cpp
struct ArrangeResult { NodeID id; juce::Point<int> pos; };

std::vector<ArrangeResult>
computeAutoArrange(juce::AudioProcessorGraph& graph,
                   const std::function<juce::Point<int>(NodeID)>& sizeOf,
                   const std::vector<std::pair<NodeID, NodeID>>& extraEdges);
```

Computes the topological signal-flow layout described in section 4. Returns one `ArrangeResult`
per arrangeable node (AttenuverterModule nodes are excluded). The caller is responsible for
writing `pos.x` / `pos.y` back to `node->properties` and calling `updateComponents()`.

`sizeOf` is a callback that returns the pixel footprint `{width, height}` for a given `NodeID`.
Typically backed by the live `ModuleComponent` dimensions; falls back to `{kSingleWidth, 300}` (280×300) for nodes
without a visible component.

`extraEdges` carries additional directed edges (e.g. from `getModulationRoutings()`) that are
merged into the graph edge set before computing depths. This ensures that envelope → VCA
modulation connections influence column ordering even though the attenuverter nodes they pass
through are excluded from the arrangeable set.

---

## 8. Drag Affordance — Grid Dots + Landing Ghost

During any module drag (moving an existing module or dragging one in from the library sidebar),
Agent Synth draws two visual cues over the canvas so placement is predictable and beautiful.

### Grid dots

While a drag is in progress the canvas shows subtle **dots at 40 px spacing** (5 × `kGridSize`).
Each dot is drawn in the `textPrimary` theme colour at ~8 % alpha — barely visible, but enough to
communicate "there is a grid here." Dots are computed only over the *visible* clip region of the
canvas (not all 10 000 × 10 000 px), so the cost is negligible even at low zoom.

### Landing ghost

As the user drags, a **translucent rounded rectangle** tracks the exact position the module will
land — the result of `resolvePlacement()`, which snaps to the grid *and* performs the anti-overlap
spiral search in real time. The ghost fill uses the theme `accent` colour at ~18 % alpha; the
outline uses `accent` at ~70 % alpha with a 1.5 px stroke, using the theme `cornerRadius`.

This makes placement fully predictable: you can see the exact slot *before* you release.

### API

```cpp
// Begin a drag preview for an existing module (selfId = its NodeID) or a new
// library module (selfId = {} / default-constructed NodeID).
void GraphEditor::beginDragPreview(int w, int h,
                                   juce::AudioProcessorGraph::NodeID selfId);

// Update ghost position. Call on every drag tick with the current canvas top-left.
// Internally calls resolvePlacement() so the ghost is always the true landing rect.
void GraphEditor::updateDragPreview(juce::Point<int> desiredTopLeftCanvas);

// Clear the preview (both dots and ghost). Call on mouseUp / drag exit / drop.
void GraphEditor::endDragPreview();
```

`ModuleComponent` calls these three methods from `mouseDown` / `mouseDrag` / `mouseUp` for
existing-module drags. `GraphEditor::itemDragEnter` / `itemDragMove` / `itemDragExit` do the
same for library-sidebar drag-ins, using `estimateModuleSize()` for the ghost footprint
(approximate preview only — the final placement always uses the real component size).

### Accurate final drop placement

`itemDropped` now calls `finalizeModuleDrag(newComp)` on the newly created `ModuleComponent`
after `updateComponents()` builds it. This means the final position uses the module's **real
component size** (not the size estimate) for the anti-overlap collision test, so tall modules
like Oscillator (553 px) or Sampler (665 px) always land correctly even if the ghost preview used
a slightly different footprint.

---

## 8b. Smart Connections

While placing a module, Agent Synth can **suggest logical cables** to nearby modules and auto-wire them on drop.

### Modes (`Settings → Preferences → Smart connections`)

Persisted as `smartConnectionMode` in `juce::ApplicationProperties`. Default: **When main I/O is free** (`NewAndUnwired`).

| Mode | Library drop | Reposition existing module |
|---|---|---|
| **Off** | Never | Never |
| **New modules only** | Yes | Never |
| **When main I/O is free** (default) | Yes | Yes, when the jacks that would be wired are still free (source output and dest input) |
| **All module moves** | Yes | Yes (dest input must be free; a source that already fans out may still tap a free dest) |

Group multi-select drags never smart-connect. Snippet drops are excluded. "Dest input must be free" has two exceptions, both below: the terminal audio sink takes a parallel cable anyway, and **Ctrl** turns any occupied destination into an insert.

### Behaviour

1. During `updateDragPreview()`, if the mode allows it, cull neighbors whose **module** rects are more than **96 px** edge-to-edge, then score **jack-to-jack** distance (same 96 px cap). A pair is rejected when the source jack sits to the right of the dest jack — that stops wrap-around cables from a neighbor on the right into the dragged module’s left inputs.
2. Score compatible jack pairs with `scoreJackPair` role matching and free destination jacks. In **When main I/O is free** the source output must also be unwired. Stereo requires explicit Left/Right (or Audio L/R) labels — two unlabeled ports (e.g. Math A/B) are never treated as L/R. Cap at the best neighbor’s audio group (stereo L→L / R→R, or mono↔stereo fan of both legs, both-or-neither when a stereo dest has a taken leg) plus one MIDI suggestion. Mod-matrix / attenuverter destinations are skipped in v1. MIDI suggestions are limited to known MIDI sources/destinations (Sequencer, Poly MIDI, MIDI Keyboard, Oscillator, …) because `ModuleBase` defaults `producesMidi()`/`acceptsMidi()` to true for almost every card.
3. Frosted preview cables are drawn in `paintOverChildren` (~40% alpha via `drawConnectionWire`). Colours resolve **only** through `GraphEditor::colourForCable` → `synth::ui::resolveCableColour`, so the cable-colour mode and user overrides apply to previews too.
4. On drop / `finalizeModuleDrag`, pending suggestions are applied through `connectPorts` (same path as a manual cable drag: poly fans, MIDI, structural pitch/gate).

Library drags cache a short-lived `AIStateMapper::createModule` probe for jack metadata before a real `ModuleComponent` exists.

### Occupied destinations: parallel add, and Ctrl to insert

An already-wired destination jack is not one rule but three, depending on the modifier and the node:

| Drag | Occupied destination | Result |
|---|---|---|
| no modifier | terminal audio sink (Audio Output) | **additive parallel cable** — ghost's audio out joins what is already there, existing cables untouched |
| no modifier | any other module | **nothing** (hard stop, unchanged) |
| **Ctrl held** | **any** module | **insert in series** — the upstream cabling is rerouted *through* the ghost |

**Why the sink is special without a modifier.** Audio Output is a bare `juce::AudioGraphIOProcessor` (never a `ModuleBase` — the graph's output channel count is tied to it) and is wired in essentially every real patch, so a hard stop there meant a module parked next to it could never be offered anything at all. Summing into the mix bus is also exactly what dragging a cable there by hand already does, so a parallel add is the unsurprising default. Every other occupied jack stays a hard stop: silently summing into something the user wired mid-patch is not a suggestion worth making.

**Why the modifier is Ctrl, not Cmd.** Cmd was tried first and lost: **Cmd-click is the additive-selection modifier** (`ModuleComponent::mouseDown`, issue #156), and that path `return`s *before* a body drag begins — so a Cmd-held press could never reach the drag path at all. Ctrl is the literal Control key on **every** platform here, macOS included.

**Both press orderings work.** The modifier is read two different ways, and both are Ctrl:

1. **Press, then Ctrl.** `GraphEditor::isInsertModifierDown()` samples the keyboard on every drag tick (never latched at press time), so an ordinary drag becomes an insert the moment Ctrl goes down. Guarded by `SmartConnectionCtrlPressedMidDragTurnsTheSuggestionIntoAnInsert`.
2. **Ctrl, then press.** A Ctrl+press is ambiguous at mouse-down — it could be an additive-select toggle or an insert drag — so `ModuleComponent::mouseDown` **arms both** and lets mouse-up decide, the same deferred classification the piano roll uses for Cmd on a note body (`cmdToggleNote_`). The drag wins at press time because it needs state (dragger, undo capture, landing ghost) that cannot be conjured later; the toggle is the half that can be completed retroactively, and `mouseUp` finishes it **only if nothing moved**. Guarded by `SmartConnectionCtrlHeldBeforePressStillArmsAnInsertDrag`.

Two things had to change for ordering 2, and both are load-bearing:

- **Ctrl is tested before the additive modifiers.** On Windows/Linux JUCE defines `commandModifier` *as* `ctrlModifier`, so `isCommandDown()` is true whenever Ctrl is down. Testing additive first would early-return there and a Ctrl+drag could never arm the dragger — insert would be macOS-only. Taking the Ctrl branch keeps Ctrl+click toggling on those platforms anyway, through the deferred completion.
- **The module body menu keys on the true right button, not `isPopupMenu()`.** On macOS JUCE defines `popupMenuClickModifier` as `(rightButtonModifier | ctrlModifier)`, so `isPopupMenu()` is *also* true for Ctrl+**left**-click — which opened the card's context menu and returned before any drag could start. A card cannot open a menu and begin a drag from one press, and Ctrl+click must stay a selection toggle, so the legacy one-button-mouse affordance loses on the body. Right-click and two-finger tap still open the menu everywhere. Jack and knob menus are untouched and still open on `isPopupMenu()` — neither is on a drag path, so a Ctrl+click there still shows Disconnect / Automate as before.

**The Ctrl press collapses the selection onto the dragged card**, restoring the pre-press selection in `mouseUp` if the press turns out to be a click. A group drag suppresses smart connections entirely and moves every member, so a leftover multi-selection would otherwise silently disable insert. Guarded by `CtrlClickTogglesSelectionButCtrlDragDoesNot`.

Library drags need one extra fix for this to hold; see below.

**Ctrl reaches the library drag too.** A library row starts its drag on mouse-down, and that press was guarded by `isPopupMenu()` — which on macOS is `(rightButtonModifier | ctrlModifier)`, so a Ctrl-held press never started a drag at all and Ctrl+drag-from-library could not reach the canvas. The guard is now `ModuleLibraryComponent::pressSuppressesRowDrag` (true right button only), the same call the module body makes. Guarded by `ModuleLibraryRowPress.CtrlLeftClickDoesNotSuppressTheDrag` and `SmartConnectionCtrlLibraryDropInsertsIntoAnOccupiedModule`.

**A modifier change is not a mouse move.** Suggestions used to be recomputed only from `updateDragPreview`, so pressing or releasing Ctrl while the mouse was still did nothing — most visibly, releasing Ctrl left a stale insert preview on screen. `GraphEditor::refreshSuggestionsIfInsertModifierChanged()` re-samples on the existing 30 Hz drag tick (no new timer) and recomputes only when the sampled state actually flipped, so a drag holding its modifier costs one bool compare per tick and `refreshSmartSuggestions` still repaints only when the suggestion set really changed. Seeded at `beginDragPreview` so a drag started with Ctrl already held is not reported as a change on its first tick. Guarded by `SmartConnectionReleasingCtrlMidDragDowngradesTheInsert`, which flips the modifier twice without moving the mouse.

**Insert previews are tinted.** An insert reroutes existing cabling rather than adding to it, so its new legs are drawn tinted toward the theme's `warning` token — interpolated over the colour `resolveCableColour` already produced, never replacing it, so the cable's own signal/category/user-override identity still reads through. The doomed cables keep their dashed dimmed treatment. Token, not a literal.

**Ghost jack positions come from one constant.** `GraphEditor::estimatePortCenter` (drag ghost) and `ModuleComponent::getPortCenter` (real card) have to agree, and they carried separate header literals — 30 and 38. Every preview cable therefore terminated 8px ABOVE the jack dot it claimed to land on, floating over the jack's label row. Both now read `ModuleComponent::kPortGutterHeaderHeight`. Guarded by `GhostPortEstimateMatchesTheRealJackCentre` (estimate vs real, every jack) and `SmartConnectionPreviewLegsLandOnTheRealDestinationJack` (end-to-end, within 1px).

**A dual FX output pairs onto a collapsed input.** A collapsed destination jack is ONE visible jack owning two raw channels, so the only way to fill both is a fan from a single cable — there is no cable-level way to address its right leg on its own. A dual I/O FX's Left jack was being treated as mono and stride-0 duplicated onto both destination legs, which also made the Right jack's pair redundant so the dedupe dropped it: a dual Reverb landing on a collapsed Chorus wired only Left. `resolvePolyLink` now pairs L -> raw0 / R -> raw1 for a dual source whose right leg is **adjacent** (the FX raw0/raw1 layout).

Deliberately limited to adjacent legs. The split-block voice modules (Oscillator, Filter, VCA, Wavetable) put Audio R on its own `kRightBase` block far from ch0, and for those the established behaviour is the mono broadcast — `ResolvePolyLinkBroadcastsMonoIntoCollapsedStereoPair` encodes it directly, and `TogglingDualIOKeepsBothStereoLegs` explains that their right leg is picked up separately from the module's own Audio R block. Widening the rule to non-adjacent legs would change **manual cable drags** as well, so it is a deliberate call rather than something to fold into a smart-connect fix. Guarded by `SmartConnectionDualOutputWiresBothLegsIntoACollapsedInput` and `ResolvePolyLinkPairsADualSourceOntoACollapsedDestination`.


### Insert-in-series

`SmartSuggestion::isInsert` turns one suggestion record into the reroute. It carries two cable **sets** — `doomedLinks` (upstream → destination, all to be removed) and `upstreamCables` (upstream → ghost, replacing them) — plus the record's own `ghostJack` → `neighborJack`.

Both sets describe the **whole insert group**, not the record's own leg, and both are deduped, so applying them once per suggestion is idempotent. This is load-bearing: a Dual I/O upstream reaches the destination through *two* distinct cables, while a collapsed ghost output fans across both raw legs so only one jack pair survives the dedupe below. Hanging the doomed link off the surviving pair loses the other one, and that cable stays connected — summing into the destination's right leg alongside the ghost's output. Guarded by `SmartConnectionCtrlInsertRemovesEveryDoomedLegOfADualIOUpstream`.

`upstreamCables` is deduped by the raw **ghost-input** channels each cable covers — the mirror of the destination-side rule, since a collapsed jack on *either* end fans. Without it, a collapsed upstream's single jack wired into both of a Dual I/O ghost's inputs would duplicate its left leg onto the right. Guarded by `SmartConnectionCtrlInsertDoesNotDuplicateOneUpstreamLegOntoADualIOGhost`.

All of these must hold, or nothing is offered:

- **Ctrl is held.** Nothing ever inserts without it.
- The ghost is the cable **source**, and has at least one audio **input** leg. A pure source (Oscillator, LFO) is refused: there is nothing for the rerouted upstream to feed. (At the sink, a source instead gets the parallel add above.)
- **Every** leg of the group is occupied, by one and the same upstream node — both-or-neither, mirroring the stereo group rule. A mix of free and occupied legs, or two different feeds, would change the summing.
- The feeding cable resolves through `findSingleUpstreamAudioLink`, which works at **cable** level (a visible output jack, never a raw graph edge) and returns nothing for a jack summed from several cables or fed through a mod routing / attenuverter chain.
- The upstream is not the ghost itself (a move that would self-loop).

**Hit-testing keys on the destination's input side** already: the jack-to-jack filter measures the ghost's output jack against the destination's *input* jack centre and rejects a source sitting to its right, so the ghost has to be approaching from the left — which is the natural insert position.

**Aim at the gap.** A library drag CENTRES the ghost on the cursor (`ghostTopLeftForCursor`), which is what every other drag-and-drop surface does. A canvas MOVE keeps its grab-point anchoring, since that card is already under the user's finger.

For the INSERT path the jack-level left-to-right test is also skipped. Both of its halves assume the ghost sits clear to the LEFT of the card it is being wired into, which is true for a new cable and false for an insert: the natural aim is the gap between two wired cards, or the cable itself, and a card is wider than the gap so the ghost necessarily OVERLAPS its destination there. Instead the insert relies on the module-level proximity cull plus one guard — the ghost's centre must not be past the destination's **right edge**, because dragged clean past a card is not "insert into it" (and that is also what stops an insert being offered into the upstream the ghost has already moved beyond).

**Candidacy is judged from the aim, not the landing spot.** `dragPreviewAim` is the un-de-overlapped rect under the cursor. A ghost aimed into a gap narrower than itself gets pushed clear by `resolvePlacement`, so scoring only the landing rect meant aiming at the gap could never earn a suggestion. The proximity cull measures against whichever of the two is closer; the card still *lands* at `dragPreviewGhost`, and `findFreeSlot` owns the final geometry either way. Preview cables are drawn from the landing spot, so they show where the card is really going.

Measured with a positional sweep (two 280px cards, 140px gap): the cursor window went from **140px, sitting 210-350px LEFT of the destination and never over the gap**, to **740px covering the whole gap and the whole destination card** — bounded exactly at the destination's right edge by the guard. Identical for every FX type, and the old far-left aim is still inside the window, so nobody who learned it loses anything. `SmartConnectionFxInsertTest` runs the gap aim across all twelve FX; `SmartConnectionInsertAimWindowSpansTheWholeGap` walks the span and checks the past-the-destination guard; `SmartConnectionPlainSuggestionKeepsTheLeftToRightFlowRule` pins that the relaxation is insert-only.

One jack pair survives per distinct set of raw destination channels: a collapsed jack already fans across the whole raw pair, so when the destination fronts two legs (the sink is the only node that does) a second pair for its right leg would wire the source's *left* leg there too. Applied to plain adds and inserts alike, and a no-op wherever the pairs already claim distinct raws; the doomed links are collected before it and are deliberately unaffected.

Scoring and the 96 px proximity cap are unchanged. An insert scores like the plain cable it replaces, so a neighbour offering a free jack can still win.

**Dual ghosts wire per leg.** When the ghost is Dual I/O, each of its legs gets its own cable on both sides — upstream L → ghost L, upstream R → ghost R, ghost L → dest L, ghost R → dest R. No leg is folded or dropped. The one place a leg still folds is a *collapsed* ghost: its single input jack owns both raw channels, so a Dual I/O upstream feeding it can only reach the ghost through one cable, and the upstream's right leg is not carried. That is inherent to collapsing a split pair, and the destination is left correctly wired either way.

**The probe carries the Dual I/O default.** The library-drop ghost is an `AIStateMapper::createModule` probe, and its jack layout decides *both* the preview and the plan that gets applied on drop — so it goes through the same `applyDefaultDualIOForNewModule` (global default + per-module override) that the real module gets in `itemDropped`. Skipping it was a live bug: with the default set to dual, the plan was computed for a collapsed ghost and then applied to a module that spawned dual, and only the left legs got wired — the ghost's fan resolved to one raw channel per jack instead of two, leaving the upstream's and destination's Right jacks dangling. Guarded by `SmartConnectionProbeHonoursTheDualIODefault` and `SmartConnectionCtrlInsertWiresBothLegsOfADualGhostBetweenDualNeighbours`.

**Preview draws resolved legs, not one segment per suggestion.** One suggestion is not one cable: `connectPorts` fans a collapsed jack across a whole raw pair, and when the far end fronts those raws as two separate visible jacks (the terminal sink does — it has no `ModuleBase` to group them) that is *two* cables on screen. `mainPreviewLegs` / `upstreamPreviewLegs` are resolved from the same `PolyLink` `connectPorts` walks, mapped back to visible jacks and deduped to distinct jack pairs (N raw edges through one jack pair are still one cable). Previously the preview drew a single wire to the left output while the drop fanned both raws. Guarded by `SmartConnectionParallelAddPreviewCoversBothOutputLegs`.

**Preview.** *Every* doomed cable is stroked first, dashed and dimmed (~18% alpha), underneath the frosted segments that replace them — otherwise the extra previews read as "and also", and the user expects the old wires to still be there after the drop. Paint-only; no new timers or repaints.

**Apply.** `applySmartSuggestions` drops **every** doomed cable first (`disconnectAudioLink`, the exact inverse of `connectPorts`, so a collapsed stereo wire takes both raw legs), then wires each `upstreamCables` entry into the ghost, then the ghost's own leg into the destination. Dropping only the current leg's cable would leave the other summing in. All of it shares the caller's transaction, so **one** undo restores the original patch.

## 8c. Double-click Port Disconnect

Double-clicking a **connected** jack removes every cable on that port — the same path as the right-click **Disconnect** menu (`GraphEditor::disconnectPort`, which fans across every raw channel a visible jack owns). An unconnected jack is a no-op. The first click of a double-click still begins (and immediately ends) a cable drag; the second click is intercepted in `ModuleComponent::mouseDown` (`getNumberOfClicks() >= 2`) so it does not start another drag.

### Preference (`Settings → Preferences → Double-click port to disconnect`)

Persisted as `doubleClickPortDisconnect` in `juce::ApplicationProperties`. Default: **on**. Restored in `MainComponent::initialiseCommon()` so the canvas honours it without opening Settings. When off, double-clicking a jack behaves like two single clicks (cable drag).
